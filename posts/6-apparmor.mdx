# Additional security with AppArmor

AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles. This is not mandator, but with this program we will limit what our node apps can access, thus increasing the security in our server.

Install `apparmor` and `apparmor-utils`

```sh
apt update && apt install -y apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils
```

Create a blank profile

```sh
cd /etc/apparmor.d/
aa-autodep nginx
```

Put the new profile in complain mode. When apparmor is in complain mode it doesn't block any access to the system, but logs all the attempts to access files that it may have blocked.

```sh
aa-complain nginx
```

Restart nginx

```sh
service nginx restart
```

Make one request to you domain by opening it in the browser:

`http://example.com:8080/index.html`

This will generate a list of this that NGINX asked to access in order to function

Allow everything that NGINX needs to work

```sh
aa-logprof
```

Verify that the changes were applied

```sh
nano /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx
```

Make sure to have at least the `#include` and `capability` lines included

```

  #include <abstractions/apache2-common>
  #include <abstractions/base>
  #include <abstractions/nameservice>
  #include <abstractions/openssl>
  #include <abstractions/ssl_keys>

  /var/log/nginx/error.log w,
  /usr/sbin/nginx mr,
  owner /etc/nginx/** r,
  owner /run/nginx.pid rw,
}
```

- Update the `/path/to/example.com/public/` line to include the entire directory and all of its subfolder with two asterisk (\*\*)
- Make sure Nginx can write to the error log by setting w for `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

Save, enforce and reload the configuration

```sh
aa-enforce nginx && \
/etc/init.d/apparmor reload && \
service nginx restart
```
